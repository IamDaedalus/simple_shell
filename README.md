This is the ALX simple shell project by Manny Quansah and Ibrahim Mustapha

# What is a Shell?
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

# How to compile this project
* You'll need gcc installed on your system (should come with Linux environments otherwise consult your package manager on how to install gcc)
  With gcc available run this command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

# How to use compiled binaries
To execute, first run the compiled binary like so `./hsh` and with that you should see a prompt where you can type your commands!

# TODO
* History
* Navigation
* Built in commands
